This application was developed as part of the Data Science course at Universidad de Córdoba, within the Computer Science degree program.
The purpose is to create an Open Educational Resource (OER) focused on "Memory, the ability to remember." Developed under the guidance of a field expert professor, it leverages investigative AI to build the knowledge base and online application. It features descriptive modules with standardized interactive tests to measure various memory types, enabling collective analysis and comparison of participant groups based on sociodemographic data.
